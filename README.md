# Malaria-Detection
PROBLEM: It takes a lot of time and expertise to differentiate between a blood sample of a patient with malaria. It can also lead to false diagnoses as chances of human error exists

SOLUTION: This can tackled by using Machine Learning and integrating said ML model into readily accessible mobile devices.A photo of the sample has to be uploaded to the app and it will classify whether the blood is infected or not. It gives the results at a faster rate compared to detection by humans.

DATASET: The dataset used for training the model is https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/proj/malaria/cell_images.zip and has over 27000 samples.
RESOURCES: https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-malaria-using-deep-learning-fd4fdcee1f5a has been referred for building the project.
